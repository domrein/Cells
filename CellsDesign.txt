variables I know about
functions I know about

// built in variables
energy
color
angle
speed
size
age // cells become less efficient as they grow older

// built in functions
getCells() // returns array of cells, nearest to farthest
getFood() // returns array of food, nearest to farthest
// action functions that end turn
accelerate() // adds to speed
turn() // adjusts angle
split() // divide energy and size in two
sleep() // do nothing
grow() // up size, consumes energy

//rules
when two cells collide, the bigger one eats the littler one unless one cell is dead, dead cell always loses, dead cells can't eat eachother
  energy += otherCell.energy + otherCell.size
when a cell collides with food, cell eats the food
  energy += food.energy
food is placed randomly across map based on the size of map and foodSpawnRate
when cell.energy == 0, the cell dies
